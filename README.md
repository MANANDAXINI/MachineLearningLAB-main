# Overview of Labs

## Lab 1: Cost Function
**Objective:**  
Understand and implement the cost function for linear regression.

**Description:**  
Introduces **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** to measure model performance, explaining its role in minimizing prediction error.

---

## Lab 2: Linear Regression
**Objective:**  
Build a linear regression model from scratch.

**Description:**  
Covers the basics of **linear regression**, **gradient descent**, and calculating model parameters to fit a line to data.

---

## Lab 3: Logistic Regression & Multiclass Logistic Regression
**Objective:**  
Implement logistic regression for binary and multiclass classification.

**Description:**  
- **Part 1:** Binary logistic regression using the **sigmoid function** for classification.
- **Part 2:** Extends to multiclass classification using **one-vs-all**.

---

## Lab 4: Support Vector Machines (SVM)
**Objective:**  
Apply SVM for regression and classification.

**Description:**  
- **Part 1:** Implement **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**.
- **Part 2:** Implement **Support Vector Classification (SVC)** using linear and non-linear kernels.

---

## Lab 5: Decision Trees
**Objective:**  
Implement decision trees for classification.

**Description:**  
Demonstrates decision tree construction, feature-based splitting, and techniques like **pruning** to avoid overfitting.
